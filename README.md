## Logistic Regression


Logistic regression is a statistical method used for predicting the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. It is widely used in various fields, including machine learning, statistics, and social sciences. Despite its name, logistic regression is a classification algorithm rather than a regression algorithm, as it is used to predict categorical outcomes rather than continuous ones.

In this project I have imported an iris dataset and predicted the type of species based on multiple aspects such as petal_width, sepal_length etc.
